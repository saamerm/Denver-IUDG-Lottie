### 1. What is Lottie? 2-5 minute -S 
Lottie is a light weight iOS, Android, and React Native library that makes it easy to add high quality animation to any app. The library renders After Effects animations in real time, allowing apps to use animations as easily as they use static images. Lottie provides a flexible animation format that is playable on multiple platforms - Web, iOS and Android, thus enabling companies to provide a uniform UX and UI.
